# GIT
Git is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005
→ Version Control System is a tools that helps to track changes in code . Git is a Version Control System . It is very popular free  & Open Source Fast & scalable 

- Track the History of the code .
- To collaborate with many .

# Configuring Git

git config -- global [user.name](http://user.name) “Aditya”

git config -- global [user.email](http://user.email)  “Aditya”

git config --list

cd      → change directory ( folder ) 

cd ..   → back to previous directory 

ls      → list of all file in directory 

ls-a    → hidden files will be shown 

pwd     → present working directory 

clear   → To clear the terminal 

# Commands of git

Clone & Status 

Clone →  Cloning  a repository on our local machine
    
    → It is used to make to duplicate copy of any repo from github to our local system .
    
    git clone <  - some link - >
    
Status → display the state of the code
    
    git status 
    
Some of status mode➖

1. untracked  → new file that git does not yet track 
2. modified   → changed 
3. staged     → files is ready to be committed (After change and add)
4. unmodified → unchanged  

So if we have added anything new or change anything in the file or code we have to run some command .

And if we add any file in our directory it will git status will show as untracked file . so we have add then commit it in terminal .

Add & Commit 

add → adds new or change files in our working directory to the Git staging area.
    
    git add < - file name - >
    
    git add .  (*for all the file which is in directory will we added if there is any      change in them* )
    
    -> staged is a condition after we add and check the status 

commit → It is the record of change.
    
    git commit -m “some message”
    
Push Command 

-> push - upload local repo content to remote repo means from our system to git hub
    
    git push origin main 
    
Init Command

When we start any project we start with our local system only and then if we have to put that on the git hub this command will help us to maintain that.

init  → used to create a new git repo

git init

git remote add origin <- link ->

git remote -v           (to verify remote)

git branch              (to check branch )

git branch -M main      ( to rename branch)

git push origin main


#Git Branches

Branch Commands 

git branch                              (to check branch)

git branch -M main                      (to rename branch)

git checkout <- branch name ->          (to navigate)

git checkout -b <- new branch name ->   (to create new branch)

git branch -d < - branch name - >       (to delete branch)

# Merging Code

Way1

git diff < - branch name - >  (to compare commits , branch , file & more )

git merge < - branch name - > ( to merge 2 branches)

Way 2

Create a PR(pull request)

Pull Request

It lets you tell other about changes you have pushed to the  branch in a repository on Git-hub.

Pull Command

git pull origin main

→ used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match that content.

Resolving Merge Conflicts

→ An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve difference in code between two commits.

#Undoing Changes

Case1: staged changes

git reset < - file name - >

git reset

Case2: commited changes (for one commit )

git reset HEAD~1

Case3:commited changes (for many commits)

git reset < -commit hash - >

git reset  - - hard < - commit hash - >

GIT HUB

Website that allows developer to store and mange their code using code. Folder of Github is called Repository 

https://github.com/

[README.md](http://README.md) → md means Mark down 

- To finalize any changes we do commit
- But first we have to  add what to changes.
